PyMotionControl

Classes and modules for building motion control
systems with Python.

---

PyMotionControl itself does not interface with
actuator controllers. Instead the user of this
library is required to derive from
MotionControl.Axis.AxisBase and in the derived class
interface with actuator control packages of choice.

Axes are assembled into a so called "Stage". The class
MotionControl.Stage.Stage provides general motion stage
functionality. However one may choose to derive from it
to form a application specific stage.

NOTE scratchpad.py:

scratchpad.py is the source file where new things are
tested and outlined, before they are moved into their
proper module file. So all contents of it are
work-in-progress, highly experimental and most likely
not working in the state you see them there.
